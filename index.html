        <h1>Web Fundamentals</h1>
        <h2>What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0?</h2>
        <p>In the case of Web 1.0 it was only one way communication via static websites, whereas Web 2.0 allows the user
            to interact with the website instead of only viewing or consuming the content all while live.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web
            application and its back-end?
        </h2>
        <p>The frontend is compiled by the browser through html and css code, encoded instructions to the browsers
            describing content to be displayed and css code are instructions how the content should be styled. The
            Backend is processed on the server, like tools to access data in a database or communicate or process
            information.</p>
        <h2>In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when you type
            a URL into the address bar in your browser until you finally view the page
            you have requested.</h2>
        <p>When user type a website address in the browser, it requests the location from a DNS server, DNS server then
            sends the location of the server of the requested website. After locating the server the browser request the
            frontend of the website from the addressâ€™s server. Depending on the request and the backend it may call up
            informatino from a database to be displayed then sends it back to the the browser. The browser then displays
            the requested information by interpreting the HTML, CSS and other relevant information..
